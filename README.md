We import telemetry data to our Digital Twin. That data is taken from the Wiener Linien API. On the Digital Twin, we conduct analysis and gain decision data. This decision data is then used for decisions for the Physical System. The Digital Twin’s static data is stored on the blockchain.

### Why do we need the digital Twin?
We can monitor and analyse data. With that, we can derive decisions for the Physical System. These decisions are derived in real-time and can be used right away, and, thus, can be seen as highly critical data.

The Metadata File concerns the Vienna Transportation Dataset API. 

## Result

The project has shown the implementation of an excerpt of the Wiener Linien´s subway network, which data is publicly available to anyone over an API. Real-Time streaming data was automatically loaded into the Digital Twin, providing an excellent digital copy of the stations. In addition, the application of the decentralized data storage and transaction technology Ethereum was able to ensure the trustworthiness of used static model data, due to the blockchains characteristics and integrity protecting features.
